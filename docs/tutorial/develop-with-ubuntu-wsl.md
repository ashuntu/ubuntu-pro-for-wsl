## Install Ubuntu on WSL2

### Install WSL

Open a PowerShell prompt as an Administrator and run:

```{code-block} text
> wsl --install
```

This command will enable the features necessary to run WSL and also install the latest Ubuntu distribution available for WSL. It is recommended to reboot your machine after this initial installation to complete the setup.

### Install Ubuntu on WSL

WSL supports a variety of Ubuntu releases. Check our [reference on the distributions](../reference/distributions.md) for more information.

There are multiple ways of installing Ubuntu on WSL, here we focus on using the terminal.
For other installation methods, refer to your dedicated guide:

* [Install Ubuntu on WSL2](../howto/install-ubuntu-wsl2.md)

In a PowerShell terminal, run `wsl --list --online` to see all available distros and versions:

```{code-block} text
:class: no-copy
The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.
The default distribution is denoted by '*'.
Install using 'wsl --install -d <Distro>'.

  NAME                                   FRIENDLY NAME
* Ubuntu                                 Ubuntu
  Debian                                 Debian GNU/Linux
  kali-linux                             Kali Linux Rolling
  Ubuntu-18.04                           Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  Ubuntu-20.04                           Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  Ubuntu-22.04                           Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
  Ubuntu-24.04                           Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
...

``` 

Your list may be different once new distributions become available.  

You can install a version using a NAME from the output, for example:

```{code-block} text
> wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

You'll see an indicator of the installation progress in the terminal:

```{code-block} text
:class: no-copy
Installing: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
[==========================72,0%==========                 ]
```

Use `wsl -l -v` to see all your currently installed distros and the version of WSL they are using:

```{code-block} text
:class: no-copy
  NAME            STATE           VERSION
  Ubuntu-20.04    Stopped         2
* Ubuntu-24.04    Stopped         2
```

## Install Visual Studio Code on Windows

One of the advantages of WSL is that it can interact with the native Windows version of Visual Studio Code using its remote development extension.

To install Visual Studio Code, visit the Microsoft Store and search for Visual Studio Code.

Then click **Install**.

Alternatively, you can install Visual Studio Code from the web link [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

During installation, under the 'Additional Tasks' step, ensure the `Add to PATH` option is checked.

Once the installation is complete, open Visual Studio Code.

## Install the Remote Development Extension

Navigate to the `Extensions` menu in the sidebar and search for `Remote Development`.

This is an extension pack that allows you to open any folder in a container, remote machine, or in WSL. Alternatively, you can just install `Remote - WSL`.

Once installed we can test it out by creating an example local web server with Node.js

## Install Node.js and create a new project

Open your Ubuntu WSL terminal and ensure everything is up to date by typing:

```{code-block} text
$ sudo apt update
```

Then:

```{code-block} text
$ sudo apt upgrade
```

Entering your password and pressing `Y` when prompted.

Next, install Node.js and npm:

```{code-block} text
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt install npm
```

Press `Y` when prompted.

Now, create a new folder for our server.

```{code-block} text
$ mkdir serverexample/
```

Then navigate into it:

```{code-block} text
$ cd serverexample/
```

Now, open up your folder in Visual Studio Code, with the following command:

```{code-block} text
$ code .
```

The first time you do this, it will trigger a download for the necessary dependencies:

![Bash snippet showing the installation of Visual Studio Code Server's required dependencies.](assets/vscode/downloading-vscode-server.png)

Once complete, your native version of Visual Studio Code will open the folder.

## Creating a basic web server

In Visual Studio Code, create a new `package.json` file and add the following text ([original example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/archive/blogs/cdndevs/visual-studio-code-and-local-web-server#3-add-a-packagejson-file-to-the-project-folder))

```{code-block} json
{
    "name": "Demo",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "demo project.",
    "scripts": {
        "lite": "lite-server --port 10001",
        "start": "npm run lite"
    }, 
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC",
    "devDependencies": {
        "lite-server": "^1.3.1"
    }
}
```

Save the file and then, in the same folder, create a new one called `index.html`

Add the following text, then save and close:

```{code-block} html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

Now return to your Ubuntu terminal (or use the Visual Studio Code terminal window) and type the following to install a server defined by the above specifications detailed in `package.json`:

```{code-block} text
$ npm install
```

Finally, type the following to launch the web server:

```{code-block} text
$ npm start
```

You can now navigate to `localhost:10001` in your native Windows web browser by using `CTRL+LeftClick` on the terminal links.

That’s it!

By using Ubuntu on WSL you’re able to take advantage of the latest Node.js packages available on Linux as well as the more streamlined command line tools.
